                    <i><h3>My Key Takeaways</h3></i>
                    <p>This project has been extremely enriching as it allowed me to further understand what is genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and more importantly, their applications in the medical and economic fields, potentially mitigating global challenges such as poverty. This experience allowed me the opportunity to apply my prior knowledge in Gene Technology and GMOs beyond the classroom, probing me to delve more into the conflicts brought up by GMOs such as the public's concerns pertaining it and its ethical considerations. </p>

    <i><h2 class="section__text__p3"> Project Title: Natural Products and Biological Screening of Intertidal Marine Sponge Species </h2></i>
    <div class="text-container">
        <br>
        <p> This Capstone project is in collaboration with Dr Tan, National Institute of Education (NIE), whereby we are exposed to organic chemistry and basic chemistry experimental procedures, namely Vacuum Liquid Chromatographic (VLC) Separation using Silica Gel and Bioassays (Brine Shimp Bioassay & Toxicity Bioassay). In this Capstone project, it aims to familiarise ourselves with laboratory guidelines and safety procedure while providing us the opportunity to work with advance lab facility and equipments at NIE. </p>

        <i><h3>About the Capstone</h3></i>
        <p>Various sea sponges samples collected by Dr Tan from Saint Johns Islands hold immense potential to become groundbreaking treatments for diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's and could bring significant impact to the pharmaceutical and biomedical science fields. Hence, as students aiding in his investigation, we are tasked to identify the compounds present in the sea sponges samples via biological screening over 3 lab sessions at NIE</p>

        <i><h3>Key Learning Outcomes</h3></i>
        <ul>
            <li> Preparation of organic extracts from natural sources and dry-loading techniques </li>
            <li>Perform quick and efficient separation of extrats using normal phase Si Vacuum Liquid Chromatography (VLC) </li>
            <li>Screening of fractions for biological activities using brine shrimp toxicity assay </li>
            <li>Use of online scientific search engines adn bioinformatic tools such as pubmed.org and Marinlit data base to guide students' understanding of sponges as potential sources of pharmaceuticla agents </li>

    <h2> Our Learning Process </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    </div>
    <h3> Week 1: Visiting of mentor and research facilities </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> We visited our research mentor, Dr Tan, for the first time at NIE </li>
        <li> Dr Tan helped us break down the experimental procedures in our lab manual</li>
        <li> From which, we learnt the significance of finding compounds that may provide beneficial properties such as antibiotic potential, in this case Dr Tan explained that he is currently researching on anti-dementia potentials</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Week 2: Hatching of Brine Shrimps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Dr Tan instructed us to prepare the brine shrimp medium in preperation for the brine shrimp assay</li>
        <li> We had to first create the right concentration of salt solution, then conduct serial dilution to obtain the various concentration for brine shrimp growth </li>
        <li> After 2 days, we counted the ratio of viable brine shrimp : non-viable brine shrimps</li>
        <li> Though, it was easier said than done... </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <div class="container-grid">
        <video controls loop height="400px" width="600px" autoplay muted src="/assets/mixing .mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
        <video controls loop height="400px" width="600px" autoplay muted src="/assets/pouring.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    </div>
    <p class="text-container-center-p"> First, we had some difficulty in dissolving the salt as the solution became too saturated. Also, when pouring the shrimp eggs, some eggs were stuck to the sides of the flask, though we can push those down with our glass stirer. However, it would still affect the total number of eggs in each flask, and possibly, brine shrimp viability.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="text-container-center-p"> Afterwards, we left our flasks to be bubbled with air overnight for viewing of brine shrimps the next day. </p>
    <div class="container-grid">
        <video controls loop height="400px" width="600px" autoplay muted src="/assets/naked brine shrimp.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
        <video controls loop height="400px" width="600px" autoplay muted src="/assets/microscope brine shrimp.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    </div>
    <p class="text-container-center-p"> The next day, we were able to see signs of brine shrimp activity</p>
    <br>
    <div class="container-grid">
        <img src="/assets/IMG_2996.jpeg" alt="" height="400px" width="600px" >
        <img src="/assets/IMG_2997.jpeg" alt="" height="400px" width="600px">
    </div>
    <p> We proceeded to do serial dilutions and counted the viability the next day. As shown, the survival percentage for most is 0%, which is unfavourable. Some factors affecting it may be: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> The salt concentration may be too high, killing most shrimps </li>
        <li> The amount of shrimp eggs added was too little </li>
        <li> During the transferring of shrimps to each concentration tube, some shrimps may be killed due to our inadequacy</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p> From that, we learnt a valuable lesson of being more careful when conducting experiments as we could not be making the same mistakes at Dr Tan's lab. Also, it made us rethink our ethical considerations when transferring the shrimps roughly and will take higher precaution in the next experiments. </p>

        <p> This Capstone project is in collaboration with Dr Tan, National Institute of Education (NIE), whereby we are exposed to organic chemistry and basic chemistry experimental procedures, namely Vacuum Liquid Chromatographic Separation using Silica Gel and Bioassays (Brine Shimp Bioassay & Toxicity Bioassay). In this Capstone project, it aims to familiarise ourselves with laboratory guidelines and safety procedure while providing us the opportunity to work with advance lab facility and equipments at NIE. </p>

        <i><h3>About the Capstone</h3></i>
        <p>Various sea sponges samples collected by Dr Tan from Saint Johns Islands hold immense potential to become groundbreaking treatments for diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's and could bring significant impact to the pharmaceutical and biomedical science fields. Hence, as students aiding in his investigation, we are tasked to identify the compounds present in the sea sponges samples via biological screening over 3 lab sessions at NIE</p>

        <i><h3>Key Learning Outcomes</h3></i>
        <ul>
            <li> Preparation of organic extracts from natural sources and dry-loading techniques </li>
            <li>Perform quick and efficient separation of extrats using normal phase Si Vacuum Liquid Chromatography (VLC) </li>
            <li>Screening of fractions for biological activities using brine shrimp toxicity assay </li>
            <li>Use of online scientific search engines adn bioinformatic tools such as pubmed.org and Marinlit data base to guide students' understanding of sponges as potential sources of pharmaceuticla agents </li>
